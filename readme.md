## Bow and Arrow Mechanics

> Gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io9d1OaSde0

In this project I have developed third-person bow and arrow mechanics in Unreal Engine 5, inspired by the tutorial series by Ali Elzoheiry on YouTube. All assets used in this project are free and have been scavenged from multiple sources on the internet.

- Character Animations - Mixamo
- Bow - I don't remember where I got this from, but it's free
- Arrow - Sketchfab
- Audio - freesound.org
- Other assets - Fab Marketplace


### Features

- Character and bow animations for Drawing, Aiming, Idle etc.
- Projectile based arrows which are affected by the draw-time of the bow
- Arrow trail FX, Bow and arrow SFX
- Arrow Killcam, which follows the arrow that was shot.
- Aiming slow-mo effect like Assassin's Creed games (_this is actually a bug from the Killcam code, but I liked it so I kept it_)
- This mechanic is developed to be completely modular, so it can be used for different characters including AI characters and it can be easily migrated to other projects as well.

### How to play

- Check the Google Drive link in the latest release
- Download the zip file and extract it
- Open `BowArrowMech.exe`
